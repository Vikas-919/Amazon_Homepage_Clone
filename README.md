# Amazon Homepage Clone using HTML and CSS

In this project, I recreated the homepage of Amazon, the well-known e-commerce platform, using HTML and CSS. The project's focus is on practicing layout design, styling, and structuring web content to replicate the look and feel of Amazon's homepage.

**Tools Used :**

1. HTML: Create the structural foundation of the webpage using HTML, organizing content into headings, paragraphs, divs, and more.
2. CSS: Apply styles and layout to the HTML elements using CSS. This includes setting colors, fonts, margins, paddings, flex-box and other visual properties.

**Learned Outcomes**
1. Gained hands-on experience in HTML and CSS by building a real-world project.
2. Improved skills in structuring web content and applying styles for visually appealing web pages.
3. Learned how to dissect and analyze existing websites to replicate their design and layout.
